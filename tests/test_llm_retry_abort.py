"""Tests for the retry-backoff interrupt signal (gptme/llm/retry_abort.py).

See retry_abort.py for the rationale: leaked subagent threads sleep through
LLM retry backoff (up to ~15s) far past the 2s conftest join timeout. The
generation counter (process-wide) and per-thread Events (scoped) let test
teardown make every backoff wait belonging to a leaked thread return
immediately — permanently, with no clear/reset window to slip through.
