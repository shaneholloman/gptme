"""Subagent batch execution — parallel task management.

Provides BatchJob for managing groups of subagents and subagent_batch()
for convenient fire-and-gather patterns. Also provides subagent_parallel()
for a simpler synchronous fan-out pattern. subagent_pipeline() provides
staged fan-out with no barrier between stages — item A advances to stage 2

        isolated: If True, run each subagent in its own git worktree so file
            edits don't conflict between agents or with the parent.
        output_schema: Optional Pydantic model class. When set, subagents are

            Results are automatically parsed when ``wait_all()`` is called — the

            ``subagent_parallel(output_schema=...)``.
        workdir: Working directory passed to every subagent. Useful when running
            subagents against a specific project directory.
        context_turns: Number of recent parent conversation turns to forward to
            each subagent as context prefix. Pass ``None`` (default) to use no
            parent context.
        context_window: Limit workspace context messages passed to each subagent.
            Pass ``0`` for strongest isolation (subagent sees only agent identity
            and tools, no workspace files). Pass ``None`` (default) for the full
            inherited workspace context. Only applies to thread-mode subagents.
        redact_secrets: If True (default), redact secrets from workspace context
            passed to subagents. Pass False only if you need subagents to see
            config values that are incorrectly flagged as secrets.

    Returns:

    """Fan out N subagents in parallel, wait for all, return results as an ordered list.

    This is the simplest way to run independent tasks concurrently and collect
    all results. Unlike ``subagent_batch()``, this function blocks until every
    subagent has finished (or timed out) and returns the results in the same
    order as the input tasks.

    Waits for all subagents concurrently — wall-clock time is bounded by the
    slowest agent, not the sum of all agent times.

    Args:
        tasks: List of ``(agent_id, prompt)`` tuples. Each agent_id must be
            unique within this call.
        timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for all subagents to finish. Agents
            that exceed this deadline are reported with status ``"timeout"``.
        max_concurrent: Maximum number of subagents to run at the same time.
            When set, excess tasks are queued and spawned as earlier agents
            complete — this never raises an error, it only limits concurrency.
            Pass ``None`` (default) to spawn all tasks simultaneously.
            Useful for large fan-outs where running too many agents at once
            would exhaust system resources or API rate limits.
        use_subprocess: If True, run each subagent in a subprocess for output
            isolation. Subprocess mode captures stdout/stderr separately and
            supports hard-kill on timeout.
        use_acp: If True, run each subagent via the ACP protocol.
        acp_command: ACP agent command (default: "gptme-acp"). Only used when
            ``use_acp=True``.
        model: Model override applied to every subagent. Pass ``None`` to
            inherit the parent's model.
        profile: Agent profile name applied to every subagent (e.g.
            ``"explorer"``, ``"developer"``, ``"verifier"``).
        isolated: If True, run each subagent in its own git worktree so file
            edits don't conflict between agents or with the parent.
            Prefer ``isolation="worktree"`` for new code.
        isolation: String-based isolation mode. Use ``"worktree"`` to give each
            subagent its own git worktree. On completion, worktrees with no
            local changes are auto-removed; worktrees with commits ahead of
            HEAD have their branch preserved (reported in the result) for
            the caller to inspect or merge.
        output_schema: Optional Pydantic model class. When set, subagents are
            instructed to return valid JSON matching the schema in their
            ``complete`` block. Results are automatically parsed: on success the
            ``"result"`` value is the parsed/validated object (a dict for Pydantic
            models) rather than a raw JSON string. A ``"parse_error"`` key is
            added to any result that cannot be parsed.
        workdir: Working directory passed to every subagent. Useful when running
            subagents against a specific project directory.
        context_turns: Number of recent parent conversation turns to forward to
            each subagent as context prefix. Pass ``None`` (default) to use no
            parent context.
        context_window: Limit workspace context messages passed to each subagent.
            Pass ``0`` for strongest isolation (subagent sees only agent identity
            and tools, no workspace files). Pass ``None`` (default) for the full
            inherited workspace context. Only applies to thread-mode subagents.
        redact_secrets: If True (default), scrub common secret patterns from
            workspace context before passing it to subagents.
        cancel_on_failure: When True, cancel all remaining running subagents
            as soon as the first failure or timeout is detected. Cancelled
            agents are reported with ``status="failure"`` and
            ``result="Cancelled due to sibling failure"``. For subprocess-mode
            agents this sends SIGTERM (fast); for thread-mode agents the result
            is marked immediately while the background thread finishes naturally.

            Use this for defensive fan-out orchestration where one failing
            subagent means the overall task has failed and continuing would
            waste resources. Equivalent to calling ``subagent_cancel()``
            manually after ``subagent_wait_any()`` detects a failure, but
            handled automatically inside the parallel wait.
        budget: Optional shared token budget. When set, each agent's output
            tokens are recorded after it completes, and any agent whose spawn
            is attempted after the budget is exhausted is returned immediately
            with ``status="budget_exceeded"`` without being started. Agents
            already running when the budget hits zero are allowed to finish
            normally. Pass a ``SubagentBudget`` to share a budget across
            multiple ``subagent_parallel()`` calls (dynamic fan-out loop).

    Returns:
        List of result dicts in the same order as ``tasks``. Each dict has
        ``"status"`` (``"success"`` / ``"failure"`` / ``"timeout"`` /
        ``"budget_exceeded"``) and ``"result"`` (parsed object when
        ``output_schema`` is set, else the summary text from the subagent's
        ``complete`` block).

    """Process items through multiple stages with no barrier between stages.

    Each item is processed through all stages sequentially. Items at different
    stages run concurrently — item A can be in stage 2 while item B is still
    in stage 1. This is the "pipeline" pattern as opposed to repeated
    subagent_parallel() calls which add a full barrier between stages.

    Wall-clock time is bounded by the slowest single-item chain, not the sum
    of the slowest per-stage.

    Args:
        items: List of ``(agent_id_prefix, initial_prompt)`` tuples.
        *stages: Callables of the form ``stage(item_prompt, prev_result) -> str``
            where ``item_prompt`` is the original item prompt and ``prev_result``
            is the raw result text from the previous stage (empty string for the
            first stage). Each callable returns the prompt to use for the next
            subagent in the chain.
        timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for the entire pipeline to finish.
        use_subprocess: If True, run each subagent in a subprocess.
        use_acp: If True, run each subagent via the ACP protocol.
        acp_command: ACP agent command (default: "gptme-acp"). Only used when
            ``use_acp=True``.
        model: Model override applied to every subagent.
        profile: Agent profile name applied to every subagent.
        isolated: If True, run each subagent in its own git worktree.
        output_schema: Optional Pydantic model class. When set, each final-stage
            subagent is instructed to return JSON matching the schema and results
            are automatically parsed.
        workdir: Working directory passed to every subagent.
        context_turns: Number of recent parent turns to forward to each subagent.
        context_window: Limit workspace context messages passed to each subagent.
            Pass ``0`` for strongest isolation (subagent sees only agent identity
            and tools, no workspace files). Pass ``None`` (default) for the full
            inherited workspace context. Only applies to thread-mode subagents.
        redact_secrets: If True (default), redact secrets from workspace context.

    Returns:
        List of lists of result dicts. ``results[i][j]`` is the result dict for
        item ``i`` at stage ``j``. Each dict has ``"status"`` and ``"result"``
        keys (plus ``"input_tokens"`` / ``"output_tokens"`` when available).
        When ``output_schema`` is set, the final-stage ``"result"`` value is the
        parsed/validated object rather than a raw JSON string.
