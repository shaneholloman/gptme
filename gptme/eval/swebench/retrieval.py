"""File retrieval utilities for SWE-bench evaluation.

Two-stage retrieval approach:
  Stage 1 (Localize): Extract keywords from problem statement, grep for relevant files.
  Stage 2 (Embed): Read top-N file contents and embed them directly in the prompt.

This is fundamentally different from prompt-constraint approaches (sessions 0ff2, 13bf):
- Constraint approaches tell the agent WHICH files to edit → agent still explores, ignores.
- Embedded-content approach GIVES the agent the code directly → no exploration needed.
